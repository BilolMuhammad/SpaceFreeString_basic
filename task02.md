# Count Digits

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the candidate's ability to understand and implement the process of counting the number of digits in a string.

## Problem statement

Write a Python function called count_digits() that takes a string with a fixed length of 5 characters as an argument and returns the number of digits in the string.

```python
def count_digits(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of digits in a string of fixed length.
    args:
        string: string of fixed length
    returns:
        number of digits in the string
    """

    # Your code goes here
```

## Example

input: string = "a1b2c"
output: 2

input: string = "hello"
output: 0

## Notes

- The string will always be of length 5.
